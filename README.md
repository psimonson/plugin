## Simple Plugin Manager

Very simple plugin manager all of the initial code is done for you. You
just need to make callbacks and register those callbacks in your code. If
you need to execute a plugin at a specific location you can call it like
this:

    PluginManager_exec(PluginManager_search("plugin1"));

Where plugin1 is in double quotes is the basename of the plugin with or
without the extension. If you find bugs please drop me an e-mail. Also do NOT
spam my e-mail with miscellaneous crap, if it is NOT about a bug and pertains
to this code I WILL NOT reply. I never reply to spam e-mail.
